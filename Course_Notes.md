#### Concluding Remarks:

This course is a nice introduction to HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. By the end of the course, one can expect to be able to build simple web pages. From a data scraping perspective, I wanted to gain familiarity with the structure of web pages and this course served that purpose well.
